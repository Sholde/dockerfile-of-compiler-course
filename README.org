#+TITLE : Dockerfile of the compiler course
#+AUTHOR : Sholde
#+DATE: June 15, 2021

Provides a *Dockerfile* for the *Compiler Course* by *Pablo de Oliveira
Castro* available here: https://sifflez.org/lectures/compil/

* Dependency

  - ~docker~

  Obviously, you must have docker to build a Dockerfile.

* Installation

  Build it as a normal Dockerfile.
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ docker build . -t compile-course
  #+END_SRC

* Usage

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ docker run -ti -v $PWD:/home -w /home compiler-course
  #+END_SRC

  The Dockerfile starts in ~/home~ so if you want to put your work
  as easily as possible, you should put it in ~/home~.
  
  REMINDER: you need to mount a DIRECTORY, not a standard file. Also,
  you need an absolute path.

  Here we put the current DIRECTORY where you are.

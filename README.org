Provides a *Dockerfile* for the *Compiler Course* by *Pablo de Oliveira
Castro* available here: https://sifflez.org/lectures/compil/

* Dependency

  - ~docker~

  Obviously, you must have docker to build a Dockerfile.

* Installation

  Build it as a normal Dockerfile.
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ docker build . -t compile-course
  #+END_SRC

* Usage

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ docker run -ti -v $PWD:/home -w /home compiler-course
  #+END_SRC

  Put the directory you want to mount in the container instead of
  ~$PWD~. Keep in mind that it must be a *absolute path*.

  *NOTE:* don't set the ~--rm~ option if you want to keep the changes
  you make in you make in the container.

** Detailled Explanation

   The Dockerfile starts in ~/home~ so if you want to put your work
   as easily as possible, you should put it in ~/home~.
  
   *REMINDER:* you need to mount a DIRECTORY, not a standard file. Also,
   you need an .

   Here we put the current DIRECTORY to the container ~/home~.
